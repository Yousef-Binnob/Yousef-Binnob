### Hi there, I'm Yousef Banob ðŸ‘‹

I'm a junior developer focusing on backend development. Backend development is my area of interest, and I've dedicated myself to mastering ASP.NET Core and its powerful features.  

During my learning journey,  I've dedicated myself to self-learning in addition to my university education. This has provided me with a solid foundation in programming fundamentals, problem-solving, development principles and writing clean code, which enabled me to learn and adapt to other new technologies quickly.

I've gained practical experience by collaborating with a team on a simple projects. This opportunity allowed me to enhance my teamwork, communication skills, best practices and organizing code.

Currently, I'm seeking a position where I can apply my skills and  learn from experienced developers.
